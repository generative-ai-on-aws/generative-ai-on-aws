    "# Maximizing AI Potentials: Leveraging Foundational Models from Amazon Bedrock and Amazon OpenSearch Serverless as Vector Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to FMs from third-party providers and Amazon; available via an API. With Bedrock, you can choose from a variety of models to find the one that’s best suited for your use case. On one hand Amazon Bedrock provides an option to generate vectors as well as summarizezation of texts, then on other hands vector engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless complements it by providing a machinsm to store those vectors and run semantic search against those vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample notebook you will explore some of the most common usage patterns we are seeing with our customers for Generative AI such as generating text and images, creating value for organizations by improving productivity. This is achieved by leveraging foundation models to help in composing emails, summarizing text, answering questions, building chatbots, and creating images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- How to manage large document(s) that exceed the token limit\n",
    "- How to find the document(s) relevant to the question being asked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposal\n",
    "To the above challenges, this notebook proposes the following strategy\n",
    "#### Prepare documents\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and a stored in a document store index\n",
    "- Load the documents\n",
    "- Process and split them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using Amazon Bedrock Titan Embeddings model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings and store into OpenSearch Serverless\n",
    "#### Ask question\n",
    "![Question](./images/chatbot_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the documents index is prepared, you are ready to ask the questions and relevant documents will be fetched based on the question being asked. Following steps will be executed.\n",
    "- Create an embedding of the input question\n",
    "- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings stored in OpenSearch Serverless\n",
    "- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks using vector engine\n",
    "- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n",
    "- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Get the contextual answer based on the documents retrieved"

    "## Usecase\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "To explain this architecture pattern we are using the documents from IRS. These documents explain topics such as:\n",
    "- Original Issue Discount (OID) Instruments\n",
    "- Reporting Cash Payments of Over $10,000 to IRS\n",

    "## Implementation\n",
    "In order to follow the RAG approach this notebook is using the LangChain framework where it has integrations with different services and tools that allow efficient building of patterns such as RAG. We will be using the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Anthropic Claude V1 available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: vector engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless\n",
    "  In this notebook we are using OpenSearch Serverless as a vector-store to store both the embeddings and the documents. \n",
    "- **Index**: VectorIndex - This model will be used to understand the document chunks and provide an answer in human friendly manner.\n",
    "- **Embeddings Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to generate a numerical representation of the textual documents\n",
    "- **Document Loader**: PDF Loader available through LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is the loader that can load the documents from a source, in this example we are loading the vector embeddings generated from those file chunks to OpenSearch Serverless. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The index helps to compare the input embedding and the document embeddings to find relevant document\n",
    "- **Wrapper**: wraps index, vector store, embeddings model and the LLM to abstract away the logic from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "To run this notebook you would need to install dependencies such as, [PyPDF](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then begin with instantiating the LLM and the Embeddings model. Here we are using Amazon Titan to demonstrate the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is possible to choose other models available with Bedrock. You can replace the `model_id` as follows to change the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`llm = Bedrock(model_id=\"amazon.titan-tg1-large\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Available models under Bedrock have the following IDs:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this moduel on retrieval augmented generation! This is an important technique that combines the power of large language models with the precision of retrieval methods. By augmenting generation with relevant retrieved examples, the responses we recieved become more coherent, consistent and grounded. You should feel proud of learning this innovative approach. I'm sure the knowledge you've gained will be very useful for building creative and engaging language generation systems. Well done!\n",

    "- Loading documents and generating embeddings to create a vector store\n",
    "- Retrieving documents to the question\n",
    "- Preparing a prompt which goes as input to the LLM\n",
