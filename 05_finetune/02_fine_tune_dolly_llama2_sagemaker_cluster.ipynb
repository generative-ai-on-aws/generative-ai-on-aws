    "\n",
    "In this sagemaker example, we are going to learn how to fine-tune [LLaMA 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) using [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314). [LLaMA 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) is the next version of the [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971). Compared to the V1 model, it is trained on more data - 2T tokens and supports context length window upto 4K tokens. Learn more about LLaMa 2 in the [\"\"]() blog post.\n",

    "LoRA is an efficient finetuning technique that attaches small “Low-Rank Adapters” which are fine-tuned. This enables fine-tuning of models with up to 65 billion parameters on a single GPU; despite its efficiency, LoRA matches the performance of full-precision fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on language tasks.\n",
