    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to train the Hugging Face Transformers [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/falcon) model with the [Sharded Data Parallelism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-sharded-data-parallelism.html) technique supported by [SageMaker's Model Parallelism library (SMP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel.html) with PyTorch 2.0 and [GLUE/SST2 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue/viewer/sst2/train) on SageMaker. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sharded data parallelism is a distributed training technique that splits the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across GPUs in a data parallel group. It is purpose-built for extreme-scale models and leverages Amazon in-house [MiCS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00119.pdf) technology which achieves a near-linear scaling efficiency. For large models that cannot fit into a single GPU, we also recommend using the sharded data parallelism technique with [Activation Checkpointing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-checkpointing.html) and [Activation Offloading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-offloading.html) in SMP first, before leveraging other techniques such as tensor parallelism or pipeline parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is also compatible with [Tensor Parallelism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-tensor-parallelism.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is accompanied by the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `train.py`: The entry point script that'll be passed to the SageMaker PyTorch estimator later in this notebook when launching the training job. This script is prepared to run an end-to-end training of the Falcon model with SMP, settings for sharded data parallelism applied, and implemented with code lines to save, load, and fine-tune the model. You can follow the comments throughout the script to learn where the SMP APIs and code modifications are implemented.\n",
    "- `data_pipeline.py`: This has data pipeline functions to prepare the training dataset.\n",
    "- `learining_rate.py`: This has functions for learning rate schedule.\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`: This installs the dependencies, including huggingface transformers.\n",
    "- `memory_tracker.py`: This has functions to track memory usage.\n",
    "- `model_config.py`: This has functions to get model configuration information.\n",
    "- `sdp_utils.py`: This has util functions for sharded data parallelism.\n",

To view the metrics and logs that SageMaker writes to CloudWatch, see [SageMaker Jobs and Endpoint Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#cloudwatch-metrics-jobs) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.\n",

    "## Deploying Trained Model for Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, a trained model can be deployed on a single device for inference because inference only requires a small amount of memory. You can use the SMP API to create a single, unified model after training: the [smp.DistributedModel.save_model()](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/smp_versions/latest/smd_model_parallel_tensorflow.html#smp.DistributedModel.save_model) method for TensorFlow, and the [smp.save()](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/smp_versions/latest/smd_model_parallel_pytorch.html#apis-for-saving-and-loading) function for PyTorch.\n",

    "After you build and train your models, you can deploy them to get predictions in one of two ways:\n",

    "* To set up a persistent endpoint to get predictions from your models, use SageMaker hosting services. For an overview on deploying a single model or multiple models with SageMaker hosting services, see [Deploy a Model on SageMaker Hosting Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-deployment.html#how-it-works-hosting).\n",
    "* To get predictions for an entire dataset, use SageMaker batch transform. For an overview on deploying a model with SageMaker Batch Transform, see [Get Inferences for an Entire Dataset with Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-batch.html).\n",
