Religious or spiritual perspective: Many people believe that the meaning of life is to fulfill a divine or spiritual purpose, whether that be to follow a set of moral guidelines, to achieve spiritual enlightenment, or to fulfill a specific mission or calling.\n","2. Personal fulfillment: Some people believe that the meaning of life is to find personal fulfillment and happiness, whether that be through relationships, career, hobbies, or other activities.\n","3. Social or cultural perspective: From a social or cultural perspective, the meaning of life may be tied to the values and beliefs of one's community or society. For example, some cultures place a strong emphasis on family and community, while others prioritize individualism and personal freedom.\n","4. Existentialist perspective: Existentialist philosophers argue that the meaning of life is not predetermined or inherent, but rather something that each individual must create for themselves through their choices and experiences.\n","5. Humanistic perspective: From a humanistic perspective, the meaning of life may be tied to the development and fulfillment of one's human potential, whether that be through personal growth, creativity, or contributions to society.\n","6. Biological perspective: Some people believe that the meaning of life is tied to the survival and reproduction of the species, and that the purpose of life is to perpetuate the human race.\n","7. Epistemological perspective: From an epistemological perspective, the meaning of life may be tied to the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, and the quest for truth and wisdom.\n","8. Ethical perspective: Some people believe that the meaning of life is tied to ethical principles and values, such as compassion, empathy, and fairness.\n","9. Hedonistic perspective: From a hedonistic perspective, the meaning of life is tied to the pursuit of pleasure and enjoyment, and the avoidance of pain and suffering.\n","10. Nihilistic perspective: A nihilistic perspective on the meaning of life is that there is no inherent meaning or purpose, and that life is ultimately meaningless and absurd.\n","\n","Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective question that each individual must answer for themselves.

The proliferation of models with relatively permissive licenses gives developers more options for building applications.\n","\n","Here are some different ways to build applications based on LLMs, in increasing order of cost/complexity:\n","\n","Prompting. Giving a pretrained LLM instructions lets you build a prototype in minutes or hours without a training set. Earlier this year, I saw a lot of people start experimenting with prompting, and that momentum continues unabated. Several of our short courses teach best practices for this approach.\n","One-shot or few-shot prompting. In addition to a prompt, giving the LLM a handful of examples of how to carry out a task — the input and the desired output — sometimes yields better results.\n","Fine-tuning. An LLM that has been pretrained on a lot of text can be fine-tuned to your task by training it further on a small dataset of your own. The tools for fine-tuning are maturing, making it accessible to more developers.\n","Pretraining. Pretraining your own LLM from scratch takes a lot of resources, so very few teams do it. In addition to general-purpose models pretrained on diverse topics, this approach has led to specialized models like BloombergGPT, which knows about finance, and Med-PaLM 2, which is focused on medicine.\n","For most teams, I recommend starting with prompting, since that allows you to get an application working quickly. If you’re unsatisfied with the quality of the output, ease into the more complex techniques gradually. Start one-shot or few-shot prompting with a handful of examples. If that doesn’t work well enough, perhaps use RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to further improve prompts with key information the LLM needs to generate high-quality outputs. If that still doesn’t deliver the performance you want, then try fine-tuning — but this represents a significantly greater level of complexity and may require hundreds or thousands more examples. To gain an in-depth understanding of these options, I highly recommend the course Generative AI with Large Language Models, created by AWS and DeepLearning.AI.\n","\n","(Fun fact: A member of the DeepLearning.AI team has been trying to fine-tune Llama-2-7B to sound like me. I wonder if my job is at risk? 😜)\n","\n","Additional complexity arises if you want to move to fine-tuning after prompting a proprietary model, such as GPT-4, that’s not available for fine-tuning. Is fine-tuning a much smaller model likely to yield superior results than prompting a larger, more capable model? The answer often depends on your application. If your goal is to change the style of an LLM’s output, then fine-tuning a smaller model can work well. However, if your application has been prompting GPT-4 to perform complex reasoning — in which GPT-4 surpasses current open models — it can be difficult to fine-tune a smaller model to deliver superior results.\n","\n","Beyond choosing a development approach, it’s also necessary to choose a specific model. Smaller models require less processing power and work well for many applications, but larger models tend to have more knowledge about the world and better reasoning ability. I’ll talk about how to make this choice in a future letter.\n","\n","Keep learning!\n","\n","Andrew\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0664cba1-437d-4073-9877-b34ff96335f1","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0664cba1-437d-4073-9877-b34ff96335f1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722070227642,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":4028,"user":{"displayName":"정유석","userId":"07427363317372764481"}},"outputId":"f63f693a-3968-4c4f-d8cf-ee568cc389d3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  The author of the email discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) and provides an overview of different ways to build applications based on these models.

The tournament, which took place from 20 July to 20 August 2023, was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand.[2][3][4] It was the first FIFA Women's World Cup with more than one host nation, as well as the first World Cup to be held across multiple confederations, as Australia is in the Asian confederation, while New Zealand is in the Oceanian confederation. It was also the first Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5]\n","This tournament was the first to feature an expanded format of 32 teams from the previous 24, replicating the format used for the men's World Cup from 1998 to 2022.[2] The opening match was won by co-host New Zealand, beating Norway at Eden Park in Auckland on 20 July 2023 and achieving their first Women's World Cup victory.[6]\n","Spain were crowned champions after defeating reigning European champions England 1–0 in the final. It was the first time a European nation had won the Women's World Cup since 2007 and Spain's first title, although their victory was marred by the Rubiales affair.[7][8][9] Spain became the second nation to win both the women's and men's World Cup since Germany in the 2003 edition.[10] In addition, they became the first nation to concurrently hold the FIFA women's U-17, U-20, and senior World Cups.[11] Sweden would claim their fourth bronze medal at the Women's World Cup while co-host Australia achieved their best placing yet, finishing fourth.[12] Japanese player Hinata Miyazawa won the Golden Boot scoring five goals throughout the tournament. Spanish player Aitana Bonmatí was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball, whilst Bonmatí's teammate Salma Paralluelo was awarded the Young Player Award. England goalkeeper Mary Earps won the Golden Glove, awarded to the best-performing goalkeeper of the tournament.\n","Of the eight teams making their first appearance, Morocco were the only one to advance to the round of 16 (where they lost to France; coincidentally, the result of this fixture was similar to the men's World Cup in Qatar, where France defeated Morocco in the semi-final). The United States were the two-time defending champions,[13] but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Sweden, the first time the team had not made the semi-finals at the tournament, and the first time the defending champions failed to progress to the quarter-finals.[14]\n","Australia's team, nicknamed the Matildas, performed better than expected, and the event saw many Australians unite to support them.[15][16][17] The Matildas, who beat France to make the semi-finals for the first time, saw record numbers of fans watching their games, their 3–1 loss to England becoming the most watched television broadcast in Australian history, with an average viewership of 7.13 million and a peak viewership of 11.15 million viewers.[18]\n","It was the most attended edition of the competition ever held.\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c8b9d517-23f8-4468-9fc7-e47322d5b2fa","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"c8b9d517-23f8-4468-9fc7-e47322d5b2fa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722070230397,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1662,"user":{"displayName":"정유석","userId":"07427363317372764481"}},"outputId":"2987eeb1-221e-4367-ef35-31b1730db243"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  Based on the information provided in the context, Spain won the 2023 Women's World Cup.\n"]}],"source":["prompt = f\"\"\"\n","Given the following context, who won the 2023 Women's World cup?\n","context: {context}\n","\"\"\"\n","response = llama(prompt)\n","print(response)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1fdadbc9-e7ae-4281-8dc7-3f3feaa62def","metadata":{"id":"1fdadbc9-e7ae-4281-8dc7-3f3feaa62def"},"source":["### 직접 해보세요!\n","\n","자신만의 질문을 해보세요! 아래 코드를 수정하고 자신의 문맥을 추가하여 모델의 응답을 확인해 보세요:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"71662250-4f89-4816-8752-96bb6749296a","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"71662250-4f89-4816-8752-96bb6749296a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722070232544,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":2153,"user":{"displayName":"정유석","userId":"07427363317372764481"}},"outputId":"ca7f883f-6bf3-47cc-b8eb-3911acbf46fd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Prompt:\n","[INST]\n","Given the following context,\n","<your query here>\n","\n","context: \n","<paste context in here>\n","\n","[/INST]\n","\n","model: togethercomputer/llama-2-7b-chat\n","  Hello!
